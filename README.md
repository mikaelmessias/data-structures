# Data Structures in C

Here are some data structures implemented in C. This rep. has both statically and 
dinamically memory allocation implementations of those data structures. 
Here they are implemented as simple as possible and it should be easy to 
understand just from reading the source code.


I hope you like it.

#  One more thing

There are other structures (not common) that were implemented as University 
homework, you can find them in the `src/uni/` folder.
